# Health and Fitness Relationship

Health and Fitness Relationship is a data analysis project with a focus on comparing and contrasting fitness activity to select health indicators. Activity measurement originated from fitness trackers, a sports logging app and manual data entry from participants.


## Project Description
 * The application does _____
 * Use of _______ (technologies) were used to ______ (why)
 * While constructing this porject I faced ______ (challenges)

 ## Table of Contents

 Health and Fitness Relationship project includes the following features.

 * Feature 1 - Load data. Read two (or more) data files including csv, Excel and JSON
 * Feature 2 - Clean data while combining. Clean data and perform a pandas merge with two (or more) data sets, then calculates some new values based on the new data set
 * Feature 3 - Visualize data. .....  still to be determined
 * Feature 4 - Best practices. Utilize a virtual environment, instructions included in this README
 * Feature 5 - Interpretation of data. Use of markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, including clear code comments, and well written README.md 


## Installation

Project Plan should list the items from the “Features List” you plan to include.

The project implements a data analysis program that uses pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform an analysis project of 2 or more pieces of data and implement a rich data visualization in Tableau / Jupyter/Plotly/Matplotlib, or something similar. 

At a minimum, the program should ingest, analyze, and display data. Any needed data cleaning should be clearly documented and repeatable.

We also want this to be a project you’re proud to show off to your employer. You should actually come to some conclusions and have clear descriptions of what your code does and why you’re doing it!

pandasql docs 
If you’re using text data, get some information from your separate documents and summarize them in a DataFrame. This isn’t literally a join but accomplishes a similar idea. For example, getting the most frequent word distributions from both documents and then summarizing them in a table.

Visualize / Present your data. In addition to matplotlib and seaborn, you might use Tableau or a pandas pivot table to summarize your data. Imagine you have to present your data to your future manager or in an interview. They should be able to understand what you’re trying to present relatively quickly without having knowledge of  how you programmed it. 


FEATURE 
DIFFICULTY
RESOURCES 
Make 3 matplotlib or seaborn (or another plotting library) visualizations to display your data.
Easy 
Matplotlib basics 

Seaborn basics 
Make a Tableau dashboard to display your data
Intermediate 
Tableau Basics 
Make at least 1 Pandas pivot table and 1 matplotlib/seaborn plot. Pivot tables are a way to summarize your data and present it easily in a way that isn’t just a graph. They can be useful when combined with graphs.

Make a visualization with Bokeh. You can create interactive online visualizations with this, but it is more involved than the other plotting libraries! Very cool though.

Best practices: these are concepts or ideas that aren’t just writing code, but enhance your project to a higher tier that will impress employers and help other programmers understand your project. These (probably) won’t affect whether or not your project runs, but can help people understand your goals and intent with the project as well as make it more maintainable. 

FEATURE 
DIFFICULTY
RESOURCES 
Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up
Intermediate 
conda virtual environments (note: you can do this with a few different modules, so either venv or virtualenv are fine as well) 
Write 3 unit tests and include instructions on how the user can run them. This will mostly only apply if you’re building custom functions and classes.
Intermediate 
 Pytest docs 
Build a custom data dictionary and include it either in your README or as a separate document. This will only apply if your data set does not already have a data dictionary or if you’re building a custom data set. For an example, see the resources to the right.

Any other “best practices” your mentor can think of: this is open to interpretation, but if your mentor has a particular idea for a best practice about your specific project, that will meet the requirement for this table.

Interpretation of your data. This requires no code but is VERY important. You’re going to be practicing your written skills here, which is an essential job skill. You can just say “clear communication skills” on a resume, you have to prove it to them. We want few grammatical errors, good markdown formatting where relevant, and explanations of why you’re coding what you’re coding. When you read through the class work-through project HERE you can see what I’m thinking because of how I have things written in the markdown cells above and below the code. Obviously, you will have grammatical and formatting errors, that’s human. But if someone that’s not super familiar with Python or your project picks it up, they should be able to make sense of it relatively quickly. This last box is a “polishing” step to make sure everything is tidy and ready to present to an employer. 

Also, notice that your README uses the file extension .md. This is just markdown, and it’s the same “markup language” used in Jupyter Notebook markdown cells.

REQUIREMENT
DIFFICULTY
RESOURCES
Annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README.md. Tidy up your notebook, and make sure you don’t have any empty cells or incomplete cells that don’t do anything. Make sure it’s all functional before your final github commit.
